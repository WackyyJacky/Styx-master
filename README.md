This is the old code of Styx, the one and only botting client for AQ3D. 

Styx was known as Beserk by Biney, which abandoned the project.

Styx is the successor which also got dropped after legal issues, which we dont care about anymore and will remake it.

This version contains the patcher (website server doesn't exist anymore) and the mpgh version, see patcher.
